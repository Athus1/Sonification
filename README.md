# README

Sonification is the process of turning data into sound, i will be using drug overdose data to create music in python.

## Data

I used an NIH [drug overdose dataset](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/overdose_data_1999-2020-5.16.22.xlsx) and reformatted it for the purposes of this project.

## Future
Once this project is finished I will post a link to a Youtube video. 

After this project I plan to create a similar project with a much larger and more complex dataset such as an image.
